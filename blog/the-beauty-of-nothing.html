        <h2>The beauty of nothing</h2>
        <br>
        <b>Intro</b>
        <p>The internet is a weird place. You’re gone for a day and feel like you missed everything, but if you’re gone for a week you feel like you missed nothing. Twenty years ago when you went on internet, you had a purpose, you needed to look up to something. You knew what you wanted to see. Back then the internet was something  useful that would complete knowledge. This is not true anymore, the technology has became an entertainment. Going on your phone has became an habit, it is now the extension of yourself. We’re just mindless making a strong brain-rot just to forgot everything that could go through our head. The generation z is the distracted,  superficial, restless generation.</p>
        <b>My feeling</b>
        <p>It makes me sick to know that this world will soon be manage by these people who lives in the shadow of their phone. Can we ask ourselves the damage that this lifestyle will have on the society? Is it really possible to have a good world ruled by people who’s experiencing lack of attention, anxiety, constant fatigue and lack of knowledge because of phone?</p>
        <b>What to do</b>
        <p>It’s based on this observation that I decided at the beginning of the year to choose a different lifestyle. I didn’t want to waste my life and I’ve decided to go nuclear option about my use of technology by limiting my phone at 30 minutes a day. Here’s the pros and cons</p>
        <i>Pros:</i>
        <ol style="line-height: 30px;">
            <li>I feel like my personality has improved, like I am not one amongst them. A more distinct and independent, I feel like having a stronger sense of self and individuality.</li>
            <li>I’ve discovered a lot of activity. When you're on your own and can't do much, staying in bed for no reason just isn't an option. You go straight through option in real life choices.</li>
            <li>I enjoy much more my rest time. TikTok and other social media used to make me like 4 hours of rest was 30 minutes. When you are more mindful about how you use your time, it feels more valuable</li>
            <li>No brain-rot : I feel alive and truly connected to the world. It’s like rediscovering that childhood thing when even a tree looked beautiful</li>
            <li>I am often bored which makes me go through books. I’ve read 12 books in three months.</li>
            <li>Needs to finish this</li>
        </ol>
        <i>Cons :</i>
        <ol style="line-height: 30px;">
            <li>Sometimes, I see messages a day late, which makes people not want to talk to me again.</li>
            <li>needs to finish…</li>
        </ol>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
        <p>will people soon return to their lives and choose something deeper? search for meaning and value has been a part of humanity since the beginning, now we see people reduced to robots, glued to their phones 24/7. needs to finish this part too…</p>
