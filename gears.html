        <p><b>I use all three operating systems to access their full functionality. While I could set up a dual boot on a powerful computer, I prefer experiencing each system on its dedicated machine.</b></p>

        <h2><i>Custom PC</i></h2>

        <p>So fun because you can basically change anything in it in less than 5 minutes. This config is shitty and probably costs less than 400$ but that's enough to play video games and handling my software needs in C#</p>

        <h2><i>Linux Labtop</i></h2>
        <p>Thinkpad Yoga X380. Can't show the neofetch because I don't have it right now</p>
        <p>CPU: i7-8650U RAM: 16GB SSD:256GB NVME</p>
        <p>This computer can be found for less than 200$ and can handle all web development if you install a lightweight OS on it (I use Mint)</p>
        <h2><i>Macbook Air</i></h2>

        <p>I wouldn't recommend it to anyone cause it's so overpriced (1520$) for no reason at all. The only reason to buy it is for developping or testing iOS applications. PS: the ARM architecture creates a virtualization layer for docker that takes 8gb of memory</p>
